Evaluating their cumulative effects provides a more holistic view of ecosystem vulnerability to human activities, which would better inform policy decisions aimed to protect the sustainability of ecosystems. Our knowledge of the cumulative effects of these stressors is growing, but we lack an integrated understanding. In this Review, we describe how climate change alters key processes in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems related to nitrogen cycling and availability, and the response of ecosystems to nitrogen addition in terms of carbon cycling, acidification and biodiversity.},

@article{zhang_2015,
	Abstract = {Climate change has profound influences on plant community composition and ecosystem functions. However, its effects on plant community composition and biomass production are not well understood. A four-year field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of warming, nitrogen (N) addition, and their interactions on plant community composition and biomass production in a temperate meadow ecosystem in northeast China. Experimental warming had no significant effect on plant species richness, evenness, and diversity, while N addition highly reduced the species richness and diversity. Warming tended to reduce the importance value of graminoid species but increased the value of forbs, while N addition had the opposite effect. Warming tended to increase the belowground biomass, but had an opposite tendency to decrease the aboveground biomass. The influences of warming on aboveground production were dependent upon precipitation. Experimental warming had little effect on aboveground biomass in the years with higher precipitation, but significantly suppressed aboveground biomass in dry years. Our results suggest that warming had indirect effects on plant production via its effect on the water availability. Nitrogen addition significantly increased above- and below-ground production, suggesting that N is one of the most important limiting factors determining plant productivity in the studied meadow steppe. Significant interactive effects of warming plus N addition on belowground biomass were also detected. Our observations revealed that environmental changes (warming and N deposition) play significant roles in regulating plant community composition and biomass production in temperate meadow steppe ecosystem in northeast China.},

@article{schlesinger_2009,
	Abstract = {This article provides a synthesis of literature values to trace the fate of 150 Tg/yr anthropogenic nitrogen applied by humans to the Earth's land surface. Approximately 9 TgN/yr may be accumulating in the terrestrial biosphere in pools with residence times of ten to several hundred years. Enhanced fluvial transport of nitrogen in rivers and percolation to groundwater accounts for ≈35 and 15 TgN/yr, respectively. Greater denitrification in terrestrial soils and wetlands may account for the loss of ≈17 TgN/yr from the land surface, calculated by a compilation of data on the fraction of N2O emitted to the atmosphere and the current global rise of this gas in the atmosphere. A recent estimate of atmospheric transport of reactive nitrogen from land to sea (NOx and NHx) accounts for 48 TgN/yr. The total of these enhanced sinks, 124 TgN/yr, is less than the human-enhanced inputs to the land surface, indicating areas of needed additional attention to global nitrogen biogeochemistry. Policy makers should focus on increasing nitrogen-use efficiency in fertilization, reducing transport of reactive N to rivers and groundwater, and maximizing denitrification to its N2 endproduct. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

@article{giezendanner_2019,
	Abstract = {A longstanding question in ecology concerns the prediction of the fate of mountain species under climate change, where climatic and geomorphic factors but also endogenous species characteristics are jointly expected to control species distributions. A significant step forward would single out reliably landscape effects, given their constraining role and relative ease of theoretical manipulation. Here, we address population dynamics in ecosystems where the substrates for ecological interactions are mountain landscapes subject to climate warming. We use a minimalist model of metapopulation dynamics based on virtual species (i.e. a suitable assemblage of focus species) where dispersal processes interact with the spatial structure of the landscape. Climate warming is subsumed by an upward shift of species habitat altering the metapopulation capacity of the landscape and hence species viability. We find that the landscape structure is a powerful determinant of species survival, owing to the specific role of the predictably evolving connectivity of the various habitats. Range shifts and lags in tracking suitable habitat experienced by virtual species under warming conditions are singled out in different landscapes. The range of parameters is identified for which these virtual species (characterized by comparable viability thus restricting their possible fitnesses and niche widths) prove unable to cope with environmental change. The statistics of the proportion of species bound to survive is identified for each landscape, providing the temporal evolution of species range shifts and the related expected occupation patterns. A baseline dynamic model for predicting species fates in evolving habitats is thus provided.},

	Abstract = {Aim: Despite predictions of high extinction risk resulting from climate change, range expansions have been documented more frequently than range retractions, prompting suggestions that species can endure climatic changes by persisting in cool or damp microclimates. We test whether such 'microrefugia' exist. Location: The United Kingdom. Methods: We examine fine-scale changes in the plant communities of a coastal grassland over a 30-year period in which spring temperatures increased by 1.4$\,^{\circ}$C. We look at whether changes in community composition and local colonizations and extinctions are related to microclimatic conditions. Results: Our findings suggest that while community reassembly was consistent with warming, changes were smaller on cooler, north-facing slopes. Closer inspection of the patterns of species turnover revealed that species with low temperature requirements were able to persist on cooler slopes, while those with high moisture requirements suffered similar decreases in occupancy across all microclimates. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that cooler slopes may act as microrefugia, buffering the effects on plant communities of increases in temperature by delaying extinctions of species with low temperature requirements.},

@article{parolo_2008,
	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to understand (1) whether warmer climatic conditions affected the vascular plant species composition, (2) the magnitude and rate of altitudinal changes in species distributions, and (3) whether an upward migration of alpine plants is connected to wind dispersal of diaspores. We compared historical records (1954-1958) with results from recent plant surveys (2003-2005) from alpine to nival ecosystems in the Rhaetian Alps, N-Italy. The presence of all vascular plant species and their maximum altitude were recorded along a continuous altitudinal transect of 730 m. An increase in species richness from 153 to 166 species was observed. Moreover, 52 species were recorded from altitudes 30-430 m higher than their 1950s limits, which corresponds to a median migration rate of 23.9 m/decade. In order to explain the observed migrations, the species wind-dispersal ability (diaspore weight and morphology) and the air temperature variation from 1926 to 2003 were considered. Species with more pronounced altitudinal shifts possess lighter diaspores. The highest increase in species richness was found between 2800 and 3100 m a.s.l.; this appears to be related to an estimated shift of the permafrost limit by +240 m during the last 50 years. The mean air temperature in the region rose by +1.6 $\,^{\circ}$C in summer and by +1.1 $\,^{\circ}$C in winter within this period. Climate warming is therefore considered as a primary cause of the observed upward migration of high mountain plants. Calculated altitudinal migration rates, however, varied remarkably among species. This would imply differential abilities of species to persist in an increasingly warmer climate. Species-specific conservation measures, including ex situ conservation, may therefore be required. {\textcopyright} 2007 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

By comparing the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species between 1905 and 1985 and 1986 and 2005 along the entire elevation range (0 to 2600 meters above sea level) in west Europe, we show that climate warming has resulted in a significant upward shift in species optimum elevation averaging 29 meters per decade. The shift is larger for species restricted to mountain habitats and for grassy species, which are characterized by faster population turnover.

Oil bodies had greatly changed. In the cytoplasm there were abundant lipid-like bodies resembling oil globules of oil bodies and particularly in the vacuoles there were oily-looking flecks. Chloroplasts had large starch grains and the lamellar system was somewhat disorganized. Net photosynthesis was highest with material stored for the longest time at -22 $\,^{\circ}$C. {\textcopyright} 1979, Annals of Botany Company.},

	Abstract = {Alpine ecosystems (alpine tundra) occur at a range of air density, water availability and seasonality worldwide on the treeless high terrain of mountains. They vary along geographic scales: boreal dwarf-shrub heaths, temperate sedge heaths, subtropical dwarf shrubs and tussock grasslands, and tropical giant forblands. Along local topographic gradients plant cover changes from windswept dwarf-shrub heath, to dense grass-sedge heath, to snowbank vegetation. These cold and relatively little exploited alpine ecosystems, nonetheless, are among those where climate warming impacts are forecast to be pronounced and detectable early on. We first review alpine life conditions and organism traits as a background to understanding climate impact related processes. Next, we provide an account of how alpine flora and vegetation have been impacted by recently observed climate change. Finally, a global network for long-term monitoring of climate-induced changes of vegetation and biodiversity in alpine environments is described. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

	Abstract = {Question: What are the tempo and mode of long-term succession and of demographic processes in an alpine community, especially: tenacity, transition patterns, predictions, growth of individual cushion plants, cyclic succession, spatial patterns? Location: A low-alpine mixed cushion /turf /snow-tussock / shrub community in southeastern New Zealand. Methods: The distribution of seven plant cover-types was recorded at 1024 fixed points in an 8 m x 8 m plot at approximately decade intervals for 50 years. The diameters of eight Donatia novae-zelandiae cushions were monitored. Results: The process was essentially first-order Markovian. There was a change in transition frequencies about 1980. The tenacity of the two major cover types - cushion and turf - was high, but that of cushion decreased about 1980 as some of its area was taken over by turf. The original informal prediction of 1955 that the cushion / turf would increase proved to be correct, probably because of paludification of the site. A prediction of 1987 made from observed transitions that cushion would dominate over turf has proved untrue because of a change in the transition probabilities in the 1980s, of unknown cause. There is a ten-fold range in diameter growth rates among the eight cushions measured, but the mean rate of 5.3 mm.a -1 is similar to that reported from other alpine and arctic sites. As cushions aged, turf colonized their centres, and in two cases new cushions colonized into this turf: consistent with cyclic succession. The pattern of transitions was compatible with a general interpretation of cyclic succession, but not definitive. Conclusions: Change is slow in this alpine community, and tenacity high. The change in transition frequencies about 1980, the invasion of individual cushions, and the decrease in spatial autocorrelation all suggest that cushions established on the site as a result of the clearance of woody vegetation after 1400 AD. Paludification may be causing some loss of tussock grass. A tendency for the cushions to break up, and the shallow peat accumulated below them, may indicate that they are the first generation of cushions on the site. Though these cushions are breaking up, other cushions are establishing, and cushions will continue to be an important part of the vegetation dynamics which may be part of a cyclic succession. {\textcopyright} IAVS; Opulus Press Uppsala.},

@article{dullinger_2004,
	Abstract = {1 Global warming will probably shift treelines upslope in alpine areas and towards the pole in arctic environments. However, responses of regional treelines to climatic trends over the last century do not show any clear trends. We hypothesize that these equivocal responses may partly be caused by limitation of dispersal and/or recruitment that is species-specific to particular trees with potentially expanding ranges. 2 To test this hypothesis, we established and parameterized a temporally and spatially explicit model of plant spread and analysed its sensitivity to: (a) variation in predicted climatic trends; (b) the spatial distribution of recruits around a seed source; and (c) variation in the resistance of resident non-woody vegetation to invasion. We used data from a high mountain landscape of the Northern Calcareous Alps in Austria where the treeline is dominated by Pinus mugo Turra, a shrubby pine. 3 Low growth rates and long generation times, together with considerable dispersal and recruitment limitation, resulted in an overall slow range expansion under various climate-warming scenarios. 4 Running the model for 1000 years predicted that the area covered by pines will increase from 10{\%} to between 24{\%} and 59{\%} of the study landscape. 5 The shape of the dispersal curve and spatial patterns of competitively controlled recruitment suppression affect range size dynamics at least as severely as does variation in assumed future mean annual temperature (between 0$\,^{\circ}$C and 2$\,^{\circ}$C above the current mean). Moreover, invasibility and shape of the dispersal curve interact with each other due to the spatial patterns of vegetation cover in the region. 6 Ambiguous transient responses of individual treeline systems may thus originate not only from variation in regional climatic trends but also from differences in species' dispersal and recruitment behaviour and in the intensity and pattern of resistance of resident alpine vegetation to invasion.},

	Abstract = {Bryophytes are the second largest group of embryophytes, or green land plants, after the very diverse Angiosperms. They comprise three main lineages (Frey, 2009; Goffinet and Shaw, 2009): mosses (Division or Phylum Bryophyta), that are currently estimated to include 12 500--13 000 species; liverworts (Marchantiophyta), that are thought to number 5000 or a few more; and hornworts (Anthocerotophyta), with only 100--150 species. This adds up to around 18 000 species, although estimates range from 14 000 to 25 000.Bryophytes in general, and especially mosses and liverworts, are highly successful plants. They display a high level of diversity, are almost universally present in land environments, and play a significant role in many terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems (Vanderpoorten and Goffinet, 2009). Although often inconspicuous, mosses and liverworts can be found even in the world's toughest environments, such as freezing and hot deserts. Moreover, in some harsh environments, such as the epiphytic stratum of temperate woodlands or the terrestrial ecosystems of the tundra, they are the chief group of organisms, together with lichens. Peatlands, which cover c. 3{\%} of the Earth's land surface (Limpens et al., 2008), are a particular and outstanding case of habitat where bryophytes generally prevail, commonly with species of Sphagnum as the dominant vegetation element. Even if bryophytes are particularly diverse and luxuriant in tropical montane cloud forests and in humid temperate woodlands, they can be found more or less abundantly in all environments where land plants can survive (Gignac, 2001).},

	Abstract = {Aims: Many studies of vegetation change over multiple decades have focused on vascular plants, but very few on bryophytes, despite the importance of bryophytes for overall plant biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Using a repeated survey of vascular plants and bryophytes in a forest ecosystem, we tested predictions of the hypotheses that (i) vegetation change has been driven by nitrogen deposition and climate warming, and (ii) bryophytes are more responsive to environmental change than vascular plants. Location: A lowland temperate forest of northwestern France. Methods: In forest plots initially surveyed in 1976, we re-surveyed both vascular plants and bryophytes in 2009 and 2012 respectively. We analysed changes in alpha diversity, beta diversity, and species composition, and we used community-weighted mean (CWM) values of species affinities for temperature, light, pH, soil moisture and nitrogen to assess the temporal responses potentially caused by warming, nitrogen deposition, or possibly a changing light regime. Results: We observed significantly increased species richness of bryophytes and decreased richness of vascular plants. Community affinities to nitrogen, pH and temperature increased significantly for bryophytes, but not for vascular plants, although the change over time in nitrogen affinities for vascular plants was qualitatively in the predicted direction. Bryophytes showed a greater magnitude of temporal community change than vascular plants both in terms of overall species composition and environmental affinities indicating a higher responsiveness of bryophytes to environmental change. Conclusion: Overall, the result of more marked temporal community change for bryophytes suggests that the many studies of changes in vascular plant communities over time might underestimate the sensitivity of the broader plant community (including cryptogams) to environmental change.

	Abstract = {Climate change is affecting the composition and functioning of ecosystems across the globe. Mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate warming since their biota is generally limited by low temperatures. Cryptogams such as lichens and bryophytes are important for the biodiversity and functioning of these ecosystems, but have not often been incorporated in vegetation resurvey studies. Hence, we lack a good understanding of how vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes respond interactively to climate warming in alpine communities. Here we quantified long-term changes in species richness, cover, composition and thermophilization (i.e. the increasing dominance of warm-adapted species) of vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes on four summits at Dovrefjell, Norway. These summits are situated along an elevational gradient from the low alpine to high alpine zone and were surveyed for all species in 2001, 2008 and 2015. During the 15-year period, a decline in lichen richness and increase in bryophyte richness was detected, whereas no change in vascular plant richness was found. Dwarf-shrub abundance progressively increased at the expense of lichens, and thermophilization was most pronounced for vascular plants, but occurred only on the lowest summits and northern aspects. Lichens showed less thermophilization and, for the bryophytes, no significant thermophilization was found. Although recent climate change may have primarily caused the observed changes in vegetation, combined effects with non-climatic factors (e.g. grazing and trampling) are likely important as well. At a larger scale, alpine vegetation shifts could have a profound impact on biosphere functioning with feedbacks to the global climate.},

	Abstract = {Climate change velocity is a vector depiction of the rate of climate displacement used for assessing climate change impacts. Interpreting velocity requires an assumption that climate trajectory length is proportional to climate change exposure; longer paths suggest greater exposure. However, distance is an imperfect measure of exposure because it does not quantify the extent to which trajectories traverse areas of dissimilar climate. Here we calculate velocity and minimum cumulative exposure (MCE) in degrees Celsius along climate trajectories for North America. We find that velocity is weakly related to MCE; each metric identifies contrasting areas of vulnerability to climate change. Notably, velocity underestimates exposure in mountainous regions where climate trajectories traverse dissimilar climates, resulting in high MCE. In contrast, in flat regions velocity is high where MCE is low, as these areas have negligible climatic resistance to movement. Our results suggest that mountainous regions are more climatically isolated than previously reported.},

	Abstract = {We use output from global climate models available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for three different greenhouse gas emission scenarios to investigate whether the projected warming in mountains by the end of the 21st century is significantly different from that in low elevation regions. To remove the effects of latitudinal variation in warming rates, we focus on seasonal changes in the mid-latitude band of the northern hemisphere between 27.5$\,^{\circ}$N and 40$\,^{\circ}$N, where the two major mountain systems are the Tibetan Plateau/Himalayas in Asia and the Rocky Mountains in the United States. Results from the multi-model ensemble indicate that warming rates in mountains will be enhanced relative to non-mountain regions at the same latitude, particularly during the cold season. The strongest correlations of enhanced warming with elevation are obtained for the daily minimum temperature during winter, with the largest increases found for the Tibetan Plateau/Himalayas. The model projections indicate that this occurs, in part, because of proportionally greater increases in downward longwave radiation at higher elevations in response to increases in water vapor. The mechanisms for enhanced increases in winter and spring maximum temperatures in the Rockies appear to be influenced more by increases in surface absorption of solar radiation owing to a reduced snow cover. Furthermore, the amplification of warming with elevation is greater for a higher greenhouse gas emission scenario. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	Abstract = {In the present article, monthly mean temperature at 56 stations assembled in 18 regional groups in 10 major mountain ranges of the world were investigated. The periods of the analysis covered the last 50 to 110 years. The author found that the variability of temperature in climatic time scale tends to increase with altitude in about 65 {\%} of the regional groups. A smaller number of groups, 20 {\%}, showed the fastest change at an intermediate altitude between the peaks (or ridges) and their foot, while the remaining small number of sites, 15 {\%}, showed the largest trends at the foot of mountains. This tendency provides a useful base for considering and planning the climate impact evaluations. The reason for the amplification of temperature variation at high altitudes is traced back to the increasing diabatic processes in the mid- and high troposphere as a result of the cloud condensation. This situation results from the fact that the radiation balance at the earth's surface is transformed more efficiently into latent heat of evaporation rather than sensible heat, the ratio between them being 4 to 1. Variation in the surface evaporation is converted into heat upon condensation into cloud particles and ice crystals in the mid- and high troposphere. Therefore, this is the altitude where the result of the surface radiation change is effectively transferred. Further, the low temperature of the environment amplifies the effect of the energy balance variation on the surface temperature, as a result of the functional shape of Stefan-Boltzmann law. These processes altogether contribute to enhancing temperature variability at high altitudes. The altitude plays an important role in determining the temperature variability, besides other important factors such as topography, surface characteristics, cryosphere/temperature feedback and the frequency and intensity of an inversion. These processes have a profound effect not only on the ecosystem but also on glaciers and permafrost. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Shifts of upper range limits are a key response of mountain biota to climate change. However, assessing whether species profit or suffer from the changing climate requires the simultaneous evaluation of changes in species' lower and upper range limits, optima, and abundances. Here, we provide an integrated assessment for 183 plant species of the European Alps. We demonstrate that, over recent decades, increases in abundance were more pronounced than range shifts, suggesting an in-filling process which decreases in intensity with increasing elevation. While most species profited from recent range dynamics, a sizeable minority both decreased in abundance and experienced range contractions. These ``losers'' are overrepresented among species of highest elevations which represent a unique contribution to the European flora. Many studies report that mountain plant species are shifting upward in elevation. However, the majority of these reports focus on shifts of upper limits. Here, we expand the focus and simultaneously analyze changes of both range limits, optima, and abundances of 183 mountain plant species. We therefore resurveyed 1,576 vegetation plots first recorded before 1970 in the European Alps. We found that both range limits and optima shifted upward in elevation, but the most pronounced trend was a mean increase in species abundance. Despite huge species-specific variation, range dynamics showed a consistent trend along the elevational gradient: Both range limits and optima shifted upslope faster the lower they were situated historically, and species' abundance increased more for species from lower elevations. Traits affecting the species' dispersal and persistence capacity were not related to their range dynamics. Using indicator values to stratify species by their thermal and nutrient demands revealed that elevational ranges of thermophilic species tended to expand, while those of cold-adapted species tended to contract. Abundance increases were strongest for nutriphilous species. These results suggest that recent climate warming interacted with airborne nitrogen deposition in driving the observed dynamics. So far, the majority of species appear as ``winners'' of recent changes, yet ``losers'' are overrepresented among high-elevation, cold-adapted species with low nutrient demands. In the decades to come, high-alpine species may hence face the double pressure of climatic changes and novel, superior competitors that move up faster than they themselves{\ldots}},

	Abstract = {It remains hotly debated whether latitudinal diversity gradients are common across taxonomic groups and whether a single mechanism can explain such gradients. Investigating species richness (SR) patterns of European land plants, we determine whether SR increases with decreasing latitude, as predicted by theory, and whether the assembly mechanisms differ among taxonomic groups. SR increases towards the south in spermatophytes, but towards the north in ferns and bryophytes. SR patterns in spermatophytes are consistent with their patterns of beta diversity, with high levels of nestedness and turnover in the north and in the south, respectively, indicating species exclusion towards the north and increased opportunities for speciation in the south. Liverworts exhibit the highest levels of nestedness, suggesting that they represent the most sensitive group to the impact of past climate change. Nevertheless, although the extent of liverwort species turnover in the south is substantially and significantly lower than in spermatophytes, liverworts share with the latter a higher nestedness in the north and a higher turn-over in the south, in contrast to mosses and ferns. The extent to which the similarity in the patterns displayed by spermatophytes and liverworts reflects a similar assembly mechanism remains, however, to be demonstrated.},

	Abstract = {Question: What is the relationship between species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and macrolichens, and two important gradients in the alpine environment, altitude and local topography? Location: Northernmost Fennoscandia, 250-1525 m a.s.l. corresponding to the range between timberline and mountain top. Methods: The vegetation was sampled in six mountain areas. For each 25 vertical metres, the local topographic gradient from wind-blown ridge to snowbed was sampled in quadrats of 0.8 m x 0.8 m. Patterns in species richness were explored using Poisson regression (Generalized Linear Models). Functional groups of species, i.e. evergreen and deciduous dwarf-shrubs, forbs, graminoids, mosses, hepatics and lichens were investigated separately. Results: Functional groups showed markedly different patterns with respect to both altitude and topography. Species richness of all vascular plants showed a unimodal relationship with altitude. The same was true for graminoids, forbs and lichens analysed separately, but forb richness peaked at much higher altitudes than total richness. The richness of d warf-shrubs decreased monotonically with altitude, whereas richness of mosses and liverworts showed an increasing trend. Significant interactions between altitude and local topography were present for several groups. The unimodal pattern for total plant species richness was interpreted in terms of local productivity, physical disturbance, trophic interactions, and in terms of species pool effects. Conclusions: Patterns in local species richness result from the action of two opposing forces: declining species pool and decreasing intensity of competition with altitude. {\textcopyright} IAVS; Opulus Press.},

	Abstract = {Mosses in northern ecosystems are ubiquitous components of plant communities, and strongly influence nutrient, carbon and water cycling. We use literature review, synthesis and model simulations to explore the role of mosses in ecological stability and resilience. Moss community responses to disturbance showed all possible responses (increases, decreases, no change) within most disturbance categories. Simulations from two process-based models suggest that northern ecosystems would need to experience extreme perturbation before mosses were eliminated. But simulations with two other models suggest that loss of moss will reduce soil carbon accumulation primarily by influencing decomposition rates and soil nitrogen availability. It seems clear that mosses need to be incorporated into models as one or more plant functional types, but more empirical work is needed to determine how to best aggregate species. We highlight several issues that have not been adequately explored in moss communities, such as functional redundancy and singularity, relationships between response and effect traits, and parameter vs conceptual uncertainty in models. Mosses play an important role in several ecosystem processes that play out over centuries - permafrost formation and thaw, peat accumulation, development of microtopography - and there is a need for studies that increase our understanding of slow, long-term dynamical processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors New Phytologist {\textcopyright} 2012 New Phytologist Trust.},

	Abstract = {A significant fraction of the Earth's land surface is dominated by bryophytes. Research on carbon and nitrogen budgets of tundra, boreal, and peatland ecosystems has demonstrated the important role of mosses in understanding global change. Bryophytes are also habitat to a highly diverse microbiota that plays a key role in the function of these ecosystems. Here we define the term bryosphere to emphasize the combined role of mosses and their associated organisms in the functioning of ecosystems from local to global scales. In this minireview, we emphasize the value of the bryosphere as a spatially bounded, whole ecosystem that integrates aboveground and belowground processes, and we highlight the potential of the bryosphere as a natural model system (NMS) to assist in the study of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We propose a formal definition of the bryosphere, attempt to summarize the current state of knowledge of the bryosphere, and discuss how the bryosphere can be a complex yet tractable system under an NMS framework. Recent use of the bryosphere as an NMS has shown how alterations in food web structure can affect ecosystem function in a manner that, although predicted by theory, has remained largely untested by experiment. An understanding of the biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and adaptation of the bryosphere can be advanced by manipulative experiments coupled with a blend of techniques in molecular, physiological, community, and ecosystem ecology. Although studies described herein have demonstrated the utility of the bryosphere NMS for addressing ecological theory, the bryosphere is an underutilized system with exceptional promise. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how plant species respond to climate change is one of the great challenges in biodiversity conservation and sustainable ecosystem planning. Current studies of the impact of climate change on plants are biased to tracheophytes, i.e. vascular-plants. Only a few studies have been carried out on bryophytes despite the fact that they are ecologically equally important groups of embryophytes with their origins predating contemporary vascular-plants. Bryophytes fundamentally differ from vascular-plants in their small size and utilization of a poikilohydric strategy for water and nutrients; their survival and reproduction are highly dependent on their external environment. Thus, the results from studies of tracheophytes cannot be generalized on bryophytes. In this review, we synthesize information about the influence of environmental factors on bryophytes to understand their relation to climate, especially to temperature on a global scale. We discuss a range of critical topics, including the responses of photosynthetic activities to temperature changes, and the consequences of temperature change on the interactions between bryophytes and vascular-plants, as well as on peatland ecosystems. As many species thrive in relatively low temperatures, with a low potential for short-term thermal acclimation to higher temperature in a hydrated state, elevated temperatures may shorten the time of metabolic activity, and increase desiccation intensity. This can bring significant physiological pressure on the survival of poikilohydric bryophytes. As a consequence of global warming, significant losses in bryophyte diversity can be expected, particularly in areas harbouring large number of species such as boreal forests of higher latitudes, alpine biomes and higher altitudes on tropical mountains. Furthermore, the decline of bryophyte diversity will ultimately lead to an alteration of ecosystem structure and function, nutrient cycling, and carbon balance. Further exploration of bryophyte ecophysiology in the changing environment, particularly the acclimation potential of photosynthesis and its biochemical and enzyme level basis to predicted changes in temperature will provide new knowledge that will assist bryophyte conservation.},

Although some species are moving already, their ability to keep up with the faster changes expected in the future is unclear. 'Migration lag' is a particular concern with plants, because it could threaten both biodiversity and carbon storage. Plant movements are not realistically represented in models currently used to predict future vegetation and carbon-cycle feedbacks, so there is an urgent need to understand how much of a problem failure to track climate change is likely to be. Therefore, in this review, we compare how fast plants need to move with how fast they can move; that is, the velocity of climate change with the velocity of plant movement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Climate change is driving latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in species distribution worldwide 1,2, leading to novel species assemblages 3,4. Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals 5. Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas 6. We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 $\,^{\circ}$C of the effective increase of 1.07 $\,^{\circ}$C in highland areas (500-2,600m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 $\,^{\circ}$C of the 1.11 $\,^{\circ}$C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms 7, the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes 8,9, and the greater habitat fragmentation.

	Abstract = {Global change drivers are known to interact in their effects on biodiversity, but much research to date ignores this complexity. As a consequence, there are problems in the attribution of biodiversity change to different drivers and, therefore, our ability to manage habitats and landscapes appropriately. Few studies explicitly acknowledge and account for interactive (i.e., nonadditive) effects of land use and climate change on biodiversity. One reason is that the mechanisms by which drivers interact are poorly understood. We evaluate such mechanisms, including interactions between demographic parameters, evolutionary trade-offs and synergies and threshold effects of population size and patch occupancy on population persistence. Other reasons for the lack of appropriate research are limited data availability and analytical issues in addressing interaction effects. We highlight the influence that attribution errors can have on biodiversity projections and discuss experimental designs and analytical tools suited to this challenge. Finally, we summarize the risks and opportunities provided by the existence of interaction effects. Risks include ineffective conservation management; but opportunities also arise, whereby the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity can be reduced through appropriate land management as an adaptation measure. We hope that increasing the understanding of key mechanisms underlying interaction effects and discussing appropriate experimental and analytical designs for attribution will help researchers, policy makers, and conservation practitioners to better minimize risks and exploit opportunities provided by land use-climate change interactions.

	Abstract = {Although some organisms have moved to higher elevations and latitudes in response to recent climate change, there is little consensus regarding the capacity of different species to track rapid climate change via range shifts. Understanding species' abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading-edge range shifts and species' traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management. Trait-based range shift forecasts face several challenges, including quantifying relevant natural history variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

	Abstract = {A growing body of literature seeks to explain variation in range shifts using species' ecological and life-history traits, with expectations that shifts should be greater in species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive potential, and ecological generalization. Despite strong theoretical support for species' traits as predictors of range shifts, empirical evidence from contemporary range shift studies remains limited in extent and consensus. We conducted the first comprehensive review of species' traits as predictors of range shifts, collecting results from 51 studies across multiple taxa encompassing over 11,000 species' responses for 54 assemblages of taxonomically related species occurring together in space. We used studies of assemblages that directly compared geographic distributions sampled in the 20th century prior to climate change with resurveys of distributions after contemporary climate change and then tested whether species traits accounted for heterogeneity in range shifts. We performed a formal meta-analysis on study-level effects of body size, fecundity, diet breadth, habitat breadth, and historic range limit as predictors of range shifts for a subset of 21 studies of 26 assemblages with sufficient data. Range shifts were consistent with predictions based on habitat breadth and historic range limit. However, body size, fecundity, and diet breadth showed no significant effect on range shifts across studies, and multiple studies reported significant relationships that contradicted predictions. Current understanding of species' traits as predictors of range shifts is limited, and standardized study is needed for traits to be valid indicators of vulnerability in assessments of climate change impacts.},

	Abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

	Abstract = {Aim: Species are responding to climate warming by shifting their distributions toward historically cooler regions, but the degree to which expansions at cool range limits are balanced by contractions at warm limits is unknown. We synthesized published data documenting shifts at species' warm versus cool range limits along elevational gradients to (a) test classic ecological theory that predicts temperature more directly influences species' cool range limits than their warm range limits, and (b) determine how warming-associated shifts have changed the extent and area of species' eleva-tional distributions. Location: Global. Time period: 1802-2012. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants, endotherms, ectotherms. Methods: We compiled a dataset of 975 species from 32 elevational gradients for which range shifts have been measured at both warm and cool range limits. We compared the magnitude and variance of shifts at species' warm versus cool limits, and quantified how range shifts have impacted species' elevational extents and areas. Results: On average species have shifted upslope associated with temperature increases at both warm and cool limits (warm limit: 92 $\pm$ 455 m/C; cool limit: 131 $\pm$ 465 m/C; overall mean $\pm$ SD). There was no systematic difference in the magnitude or variance of shifts at warm versus cool limits and thus no indication that cool limits are more directly controlled by temperature. Species' elevational extents and available area significantly decreased for mountaintop species. Main conclusions: Our results do not support the long-standing hypothesis that cool limits are more sensitive or responsive to temperature. We find that, across the globe, mountaintop species' ranges are significantly shrinking as they shift upslope, supporting predictions that high elevation species are especially vulnerable to temperature increases. Our synthesis highlights the extreme variation in species' distri-butional responses to warming, which may indicate that biotic interactions play a more prominent role in setting range limits than previously thought.

	Abstract = {Poleward and upward shifts are the most frequent types of range shifts that have been reported in response to contemporary climate change. However, the number of reports documenting other types of range shifts - such as in east-west directions across longitudes or, even more unexpectedly, towards tropical latitudes and lower elevations - is increasing rapidly. Recent studies show that these range shifts may not be so unexpected once the local climate changes are accounted for. We here provide an updated synthesis of the fast-moving research on climate-related range shifts. By describing the current state of the art on geographical patterns of species range shifts under contemporary climate change for plants and animals across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, we identified a number of research shortfalls. In addition to the recognised geographic shortfall in the tropics, we found taxonomic and methodological shortfalls with knowledge gaps regarding range shifts of prokaryotes, lowland range shifts of terrestrial plants, and bathymetric range shifts of marine plants. Based on this review, we provide a research agenda for filling these gaps. We outline a comprehensive framework for assessing multidimensional changes in species distributions, which should then be contrasted with expectations based on climate change indices, such as velocity measures accounting for complex local climate changes. Finally, we propose a unified classification of geographical patterns of species range shifts, arranged in a bi-dimensional space defined by species' persistence and movement rates. Placing the observed and expected shifts into this bi-dimensional space should lead to more informed assessments of extinction risks.},

Here we use 867 vegetation samples above the treeline from 60 summit sites in all major European mountain systems to show that ongoing climate change gradually transforms mountain plant communities. We provide evidence that the more cold-adapted species decline and the more warm-adapted species increase, a process described here as thermophilization. At the scale of individual mountains this general trend may not be apparent, but at the larger, continental scale we observed a significantly higher abundance of thermophilic species in 2008, compared with 2001.

	Abstract = {Many studies have investigated the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of plant species, but few have attempted to constrain projections through plant dispersal limitations. Instead, most studies published so far have simplified dispersal as either unlimited or null. However, depending on the dispersal capacity of a species, landscape fragmentation, and the rate of climatic change, these assumptions can lead to serious over- or underestimation of the future distribution of plant species. To quantify the discrepancies between simulations accounting for dispersal or not, we carried out projections of future distribution over the 21st century for 287 mountain plant species in a study area of the western Swiss Alps. For each species, simulations were run for four dispersal scenarios (unlimited dispersal, no dispersal, realistic dispersal, and realistic dispersal with long-distance dispersal events) and under four climate change scenarios. Although simulations accounting for realistic dispersal limitations did significantly differ from those considering dispersal as unlimited or null in terms of projected future distribution, the unlimited dispersal simplification did nevertheless provide good approximations for species extinctions under more moderate climate change scenarios. Overall, simulations accounting for dispersal limitations produced, for our mountainous study area, results that were significantly closer to unlimited dispersal than to no dispersal. Finally, analysis of the temporal pattern of species extinctions over the entire 21st century revealed that important species extinctions for our study area might not occur before the 2080-2100 period, due to the possibility of a large number of species shifting their distribution to higher elevation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Ecography.},

	Abstract = {Long-term, slow ecological processes such as changes in plant community structure and composition strongly regulate ecosystem responses to climate change. Shifts in plant community are expected in chronically altered environments under warming. However, experimental evidence for long-term shifts and the associated mechanisms is still scarce in temperate grasslands. Here, we explore the long-term responses of a prairie plant community to 14-year (2000-2013) manipulations of climate warming and clipping in Oklahoma, USA. Infrared heaters were used to elevate soil temperature by about 2 $\,^{\circ}$C all year round, and annual clipping was applied to mimic hay harvest. Community composition was resistant to experimental warming in the first seven years, but started to show responses starting from the eighth year; clipping consistently affected community composition over the years. Compositional change under long-term warming was mainly due to one invasive species and three dominant species. The negative correlations in relative abundance between the invasive species and the dominant species suggest interspecific competition. Community structure (i.e. richness, evenness and diversity) had no overall response to experimental warming. However, in 2007, the extreme wet year, warming reduced species richness by 30{\%}. Clipping promoted species richness by 10{\%} on average over the 14 years but decreased community evenness. Warming did not interact with clipping in influencing the plant community variables. Synthesis. Our study provides experimental evidence for long-term shifts in plant community composition due to warming and revealed novel mechanisms (i.e. species invasion and associated biotic interactions) underlying the long-term shift. The results also suggest that climate extremes may elicit or advance community responses to climate warming. The findings highlight that long-term climate change experiments are essential to reveal potential shifts in community composition.},

	Abstract = {Predicting climate change impact on ecosystem structure and services is one of the most important challenges in ecology. Until now, plant species response to climate change has been described at the level of fixed plant functional types, an approach limited by its inflexibility as there is much interspecific functional variation within plant functional types. Considering a plant species as a set of functional traits greatly increases our possibilities for analysis of ecosystem functioning and carbon and nutrient fluxes associated therewith. Moreover, recently assembled large-scale databases hold comprehensive per-species data on plant functional traits, allowing a detailed functional description of many plant communities on Earth. Here, we show that plant functional traits can be used as predictors of vegetation response to climate warming, accounting in our test ecosystem (the species-rich alpine belt of Caucasus mountains, Russia) for 59{\%} of variability in the per-species abundance relation to temperature. In this mountain belt, traits that promote conservative leaf water economy (higher leaf mass per area, thicker leaves) and large investments in belowground reserves to support next year's shoot buds (root carbon content) were the best predictors of the species increase in abundance along with temperature increase. This finding demonstrates that plant functional traits constitute a highly useful concept for forecasting changes in plant communities, and their associated ecosystem services, in response to climate change.},

	Abstract = {Global climate change is predicted to have large impacts on the phenology and reproduction of alpine plants, which will have important implications for plant demography and community interactions, trophic dynamics, ecosystem energy balance, and human livelihoods. In this article we report results of a 3-year, fully factorial experimental study exploring how warming, snow addition, and their combination affect reproductive phenology, effort, and success of four alpine plant species belonging to three different life forms in a semiarid, alpine meadow ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that warming and snow addition change reproductive phenology and success, but responses are not uniform across species. Moreover, traits associated with resource acquisition, such as rooting depth and life history (early vs. late flowering), mediate plant phenology, and reproductive responses to changing climatic conditions. Specifically, we found that warming delayed the reproductive phenology and decreased number of inflorescences of Kobresia pygmaea C. B. Clarke, a shallow-rooted, early-flowering plant, which may be mainly constrained by upper-soil moisture availability. Because K. pygmaea is the dominant species in the alpine meadow ecosystem, these results may have important implications for ecosystem dynamics and for pastoralists and wildlife in the region. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{chen_2011,
	Abstract = {The distributions of many terrestrial organisms are currently shifting in latitude or elevation in response to changing climate. Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.},
